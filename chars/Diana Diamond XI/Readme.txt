 CHARACTER INFORMATION:
---------------------------------Quoted from SNK---------------------------------------------
  "Diana's the Amazon featured in Kula's sequences. She is a top executive for NESTS
but is portrayed as Kula's guardian in the background story. If you compared NESTS to a company...
we often use this metaphor, but we don't have a clue which position would fit her or Foxy. 
Judging by her loathing of elite managers ("college boys"), we could say she's a "big-sister section chief" 
who climbed the corporate ladder with extremely hard work. 
Working with a "fabulous babe" boss like her would be whack (but a bit scary, though)!"______Whack????
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SPECIAL SYSTEMS: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flying-  It's been made very clear to me that she has the ability, it's shown quite a bit, it felt only natrual,
However, you can't use most of your moves, and if you're hit, you get knocked out of the sky. I know it wont be taken well by many, but SNK made her, Changing that would be wrong in my mind.
   Energy Butterflies- I hate having to look up at my energy-bar when hoping to God
 that I have enough energy to get the fighter I'm up against off me with a supermove, therefore when you see butterflies apear around her, thats a sign she's ready for something.

Low Health Animation- A first for any SNK fighter that I know of. When she's low on life, it changes her standing animation, if you're low on health, it shows.

Charge normal SNK charge

Telaporting-  It can be done in the air, jumping or while flying, as long as you keep her energy high, then theres nowhere your foe can hide. 

Air Dash- Even if your low on energy she can give herself a quick boost of speed in the air once. 

Tount And dodge added (KOF 01 style)
